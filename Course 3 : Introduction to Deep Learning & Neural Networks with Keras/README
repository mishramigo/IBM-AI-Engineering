This is the third course in IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificte.

This course introduced me to the field of deep learning and 
helped me answer many questions that people are asking nowadays, like what is deep learning, and how do deep learning models compare to artificial neural networks? 
I learnt about the different deep learning models and built my first deep learning model using the Keras library.
