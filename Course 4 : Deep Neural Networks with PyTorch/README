This is the fourth course in the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate.

The course starts with Pytorch's  tensors and Automatic differentiation package. 
Then each section covers different models starting off with fundamentals such as Linear Regression, and logistic/softmax regression. 
Followed by Feedforward deep neural networks, the role of different activation functions, normalization and dropout layers. 
Then Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning is covered. 
Finally, several other Deep learning methods is covered.
