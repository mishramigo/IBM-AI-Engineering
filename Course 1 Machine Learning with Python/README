This is the first course of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificates.
The notebooks are well sorted in week by week basis.

This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. 

In this course, I will be reviewing two main components:
First, I will be demonstrating about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
Second, I will give a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms.
